## Q1: Is it possible that the error is caused by the previous service producer using rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t, and the current consumer receiving messages with different timestamps?

A1: 

Even if the Producer uses rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t, InvalidTimestamp errors may still occur if the timestamp settings of the previous Producer and the current Consumer do not match.

If the previous Producer used rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t to publish messages, and the Consumer uses timestamps to consume messages, InvalidTimestamp errors may occur if the timestamp settings of the Producer and the Consumer are different. In this case, the behavior of the Producer using rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t is not related to the Consumer using timestamps, but is related to the mismatch of the timestamp settings between the Producer and the Consumer.

Therefore, when using rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t, it is also necessary to ensure that the Producer and Consumer use the same timestamp settings. If the Producer uses rd_kafka_partition_leader_epoch_t to publish messages, the Consumer needs to use the same timestamp settings when consuming messages to avoid InvalidTimestamp errors.


## Q2: Is CreateTime affected by the time offset of the server?

A2: 

In Kafka, CreateTime timestamps represent the time when a message was produced. If the time on the Kafka server where the message is stored is not in sync with the time on the producer's machine, the CreateTime timestamp of the message may be inaccurate.

For example, if the producer's machine is ahead of the Kafka server by 10 seconds, when the producer publishes a message, the CreateTime timestamp of the message will be 10 seconds earlier than the time recorded by the Kafka server. In this case, when the consumer consumes the message, it will think that the message was produced 10 seconds earlier than it actually was.

Therefore, to ensure that CreateTime timestamps are accurate, it is important to keep the time on the Kafka server in sync with the producer's machine. NTP or other time synchronization tools can be used to achieve time synchronization and ensure the accuracy of CreateTime timestamps.
